# Grey-scale Image Classification using KERAS

## Disclaimer
This is a research project submitted for credit for a course that we are currently taking. The results seen here are subjective and should not be considered as final or accurate. 

## 1. Objective
During the history of computers (and computing), we have seen a significant rise in computing capabilities and a proportional drop in the cost of resources (such as CPUs, and memory). Note that during this period, wants and aspirations have also transcended from when we yearned for owning a computer one day, to the present wherein we have mobile devices (often a 100 times more powerful) in our very own pockets (or perhaps just strewn about our homes?)!

Using a similar thought process, we wish to submit that today's scenario - where more data leads to better learning, which in turn leads to accurate predictions - would soon change to a scenario where accuracy may be sacrificed for relatively quick training (learning) and deployment. In light of this, we plan on using only our laptops (see configuration below) and a fairly stable internet connection. We will deliberately be staying away from online cloud computing platforms, as students typically would not have the resources to pay for such platforms, nor sufficient time to utilize the free versions owing to their contraints on duration of usage. 

Thus, our objectives include:
  1. Classifying images from the Flickr27 dataset. Starting with three classes and gradually increasing until we breach our memory or computation resources.
  2. Keeping training time to a minimum. Minimum is subjective. Here, we are keeping the training time between 6-8 hours. Any model that takes longer would be difficult to use for prediction and testing of results at the end of the day.
  3. Using the least amount of resources possible. We are talking about limitations of the computer that is being used. Basis recommendations from leaders in the research space, the computers that we are using will be slightly higher that the minimum system requirements but a lot lower than the recommended systems. Please look at the section on System Configuration for more details.
 
## 2. Learnings so far ...
On the offset, let me remind you that we have three months to complete this project. 
In terms of data, our understanding is the more we have, the more accurate our prediction will be. In keeping with our objective, 

## 3. Requirements
## 4. System configuration
## 5. Basic code files
## 6. Conclusion
## 7. What changes would I make?
  1. Find a way to compare images and get a score of the similarity between them. This way we remove duplicates from our train and test sets.

## About the author  
My name is Prem and I am currently working as a freelance consultant in SAP-ABAP and Android. I have a total of 14 years of experience and am currently attending a course in Machine Learning. My primary focus is on Image Classification using Keras and Tensorflow. The learning I do is generally task oriented. My colleagues of this project are Satyajit (The Doctor) and Vivek (The Visonary). While Satya is will be following a more methodical approach to understanding the technical aspects of the code, Vivek will be working on the business front of this application and visualisation of the data that is being collected.
